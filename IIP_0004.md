## Abstract
This IIP introduces **timelock-based block reward structure**.

## Plain language tl;dr

**“Timelock-based block reward structure”** — The ION blockchain will issue higher block rewards for a longer time commitment of masternode operation.

* ***Effect:*** Higher block rewards are designed to incentivize the direction of computing power to maintain secure blockchain protocols. This is an improvement over a protocol that drops off precipitously leaving insufficient predictable motivation to maintain a growing ecosystem that includes not only ION, but all secondary tokens on the core blockchain.

## Motivation
* Timelock-based block reward structure
 * A proposal to distribute a progressively higher percentage of block rewards to those masternode operators that commit to locking the collateral output transaction for relatively longer periods of time.

## Specification

Timelock-based masternode reward structure.

| Days Locked | Masternode block reward share | Staking wallet block reward share |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0           | 50%                           | 50%                               |
| 30          | 55%                           | 45%                               |
| 90          | 60%                           | 40%                               |
| 180         | 65%                           | 35%                               |
| 270         | 70%                           | 30%                               |
| 360         | 75%                           | 25%                               |
| 450         | 80%                           | 20%                               |
| 540         | 90%                           | 10%                               |

Masternode collateral inputs will be timelock transactions. Masternode operators will be able to select the timelock period according to the schedule above. Masternode operators committing to operate masternodes for longer time periods will receive larger percentages of the block reward.

## Changelog

*Date: 02-06-2018*

Following community hangout, the reward structure has been extended to 1.25 years and 1.5 year time commitments.
